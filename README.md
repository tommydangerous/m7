## Technology stack

1. Redux

## Frontend Development
React and Redux code lives in the `app/javascript` directory.

The single page app is rendered in `pages/index.html.erb`. On this page, it loads a JavaScript
package from `app/javascript/packs/pages/index.js`.

Each pack file loads an app. In this case, it loads `app/javascript/apps/pages/index/index.jsx`.

## Frontend project structure
All page specific components live inside `app/javascript/apps/[page_name]/[app_name]/`.
For example, the Login page app lives in `app/javascript/apps/sessions/login/`.

Here is a description for all directories under `app/javascript/`:

### `action_creators/`
Functions for interacting with the store.
Use the `SimpleActionCreatorGenerator` to create action creators with base CRUD operations.
Look at the `timesheetActionCreators` as an example on how to use the generator.

### `actions/`
Declare your Redux action constants here.
For simple CRUD actions, use the `SimpleActionGenerator` to quickly generate action names for
your basic CRUD operations as well as the failed, started, and succeeded states.
You will rarely need this function since it is only used in the `SimpleReducerGenerator`.

### `api/`
Code used to interact with the remote API server. You do not need to import this file into any
of your code. If you use the `SimpleActionCreatorGenerator` to generate your action creator,
you will be able to make requests without importing the `Api.js` file directly.

### `apps/`
All app specific components lives in here.

### `components/`
Components that are commonly used in multiple apps live here. Currently, the most commonly used
component is the `Modal` component and the `SimpleForm` component.

The `Modal` component will enable you to render components inside a modal that can be closed or
shown by using functions from the `modalActionCreators`.

The `SimpleForm` component allows you to quickly render forms. Use `ExpenseForm` as an example on
how to render a `SimpleForm`.

### `containers/`
Containers are used to render components with properties from the global store.

### `mocks/`
Helper functions to generate fake data.

### `packs/`
Entry point for single page apps.

### `reducers/`
Redux reducers. Use `SimpleReducerGenerator` to create a basic reducer for all CRUD operations.
See `expenseReducers` as an example on how to generate a reducer. Once you create your reducer,
add all reducers to the `rootReducer`.

### `routes/`
React router routes.

### `selectors/`
Helper functions for mapping state to props in components.

### `shapes/`
React prop type shapes.

### `stores/`
Single store for all apps. Also contains functions for interacting with the local storage.
You typically will not need to make any changes to the files in this directory.

### `utils/`
All helper functions that are shared across apps.

## Common Files
### `SimpleActionCreatorGenerator`
This will create an action generator with common CRUD methods;
e.g. `create`, `deleteObject`, `index`, `show` (unused), `update`, and a few more.

Here are the available parameters:

1. `name`: the plural name of the resource you are generating for
1. `payloadParsers`: custom parsers of payload used in `create` or `update` operations
1. `singularName`: if the plural name is difficult to singularize, use this parameter

```javascript
// expenseActionCreators.js

const generator = SimpleActionCreatorGenerator({
  name: 'expenses', // Required
  // Optional
  payloadParsers: {
    create: sharedPayloadParser,
    update: sharedPayloadParser,
  },
  singularName: 'expense', // Optional
});

export function create(opts) {
  return generator.create(opts);
}
```

### `SimpleReducerGenerator`
This will create a reducer that properly updates the state after any CRUD operation.

Here are the available parameters:

1. `action`: this is required; use the function's argument as this value
1. `name`: the plural name of the resource you are generating for
1. `responseParsers`: if you have custom parsing logic for each CRUD operation, use this parameter
to parse the response from the server
1. `saveParsers`: if you want to parse the payload after the server has already successfully
performed a desired operation, use this parameter to do so
1. `singularName`: if the plural name is difficult to singularize, use this parameter
to explicitly declare the singular name of the resource you are generating a reducer for
1. `states`: you must always include the state argument as the `current` value under the
`states` parameter, if you want to include an initial state and a reset state then you can
add them here as well

```javascript
// expenseReducers.jsx

export default function reducers(state, action) {
  return SimpleReducerGenerator({
    action, // Required
    name: 'expenses', // Required
    // Optional
    responseParsers: {
      create: singleObjectParser,
      index: resp => resp.TimeEntries.map(obj => singleObjectParser(obj)),
      update: singleObjectParser,
    },
    // Optional
    saveParsers: {
      create: singleObjectParser,
      update: singleObjectParser,
    },
    singularName: 'expense', // Optional
    states: {
      current: state, // Required
      initial: INITIAL_STATE, // Optional
      reset: RESET_STATE, // Optional
    },
  });
}
```

### `SimpleForm`
Quickly create forms.

Here are the available parameters:

1. `children`: you can render additional components inside the form
1. `error`: the error message you want to display
1. `fields`: an array of hashes that will configure each field;
for examples, look at `expenses/main/utils/constants.js` for commonly used configuration keys
1. `header`: the header text at the top of the form
1. `loading`: if true, the form will disable the CTA and show a loader
1. `onClickCancel`: what happens when a user clicks the cancel button
1. `onSubmitForm`: what happens when a user submits the form
1. `onSubmitFormCallback`: what happens after the form is submitted
1. `submitFormButtonText`: the default text for the submit button is `Save`, if you choose to
customize the text then use this property

```javascript
// ExpenseForm.jsx

<SimpleForm
  error="What is going on?" // Optional
  fields={[
    {...},
    {...},
    {...},
  ]} // Required
  header="Add a new expense" // Optional
  loading={false} // Optional
  onClickCancel={() => {...}} // Optional
  onSubmitForm={() => {...}} // Required
  onSubmitFormCallback={() => {...}} // Optional
  submitFormButtonText="Save now" // Optional
/>
```

### `SimpleFormWithStore`
This component is powered by a `SimpleForm` component; however, it uses action creators and
selectors in order to populate its form values with existing state.

```javascript
// ExpenseForm.jsx

const FormWithStore = SimpleFormWithStore({
  actionCreators: expenseActionCreators,
  selector: state => expenseSelectors.rootSelector(state).expense,
});

<FormWithStore
  fields={[...]} // Required
  onSubmitForm={payload => {...}} // Required
/>
```
